# Workshop: A more strict SQL schema for Brightway

This workshop is about the development of a new Brightway tool, which allows the integration of external SQL databases to Brightway. The tool is wrapped as a python package for easier distribution and consists of three components:

1. A sub package which holds the importing and exporting routines.
2. A database model (giving the structure of the SQL database)
3. A web-app which allows a simple execution of the exporting and importing of data.

This new tool is available on github: https://github.com/Blowgren/bw2extdb/tree/main. Follow the link for a description how to install the package (tool).

## Structure:
1. The workshop starts with a short presentation on the problem setting, objectives, implementation.
2. Then the tool is domenstrated using the App
3. Group work.

## Group work tasks:
### Group 1: Schema
Discuss the nomenclature of the database uising the Miro board: 
What information should be captured? What variables are needed, and which are optional? What information is missing? 
**Please use the Miro board and the instructions there**

### Group 2: Ontology
What would the next steps be towards a standardized explicit ontology and vocabulary? Sketch a knowledge graph of the information which is important to you.

### Group 3: Use cases
E.g., For those who see a direct use. Discussing practical use cases, what challenges do you see? what variations do you need? how can the program remain generalizable?

**Please use the Miro board and the instructions there**

### Group 4: Individual testing
For those of you who do not want to join a group and want to explore the tool themselves. Especially for the online attendees.

Two options:
1. Go through the two notebooks in this repo
2. Install `bw2extdb` (see instructions on https://github.com/Blowgren/bw2extdb/tree/main) and play around with the app.

Open the forms: https://forms.gle/xm9BPv3SmUjfkTiC9 which gives you some guiding feedback questions.
