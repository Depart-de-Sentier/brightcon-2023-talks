    "This workshop is about the development of a new Brightway tool, which allows the integration of external SQL databases to Brightway. The tool is wrapped as a python package for easier distribution and consists of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A sub package which holds the importing and exporting routines.\n",
    "2. A database model (giving the structure of the SQL database)\n",
    "3. A web-app which allows a simple execution of the exporting and importing of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new tool is available on github: https://github.com/Blowgren/bw2extdb/tree/main. Follow the link for a description how to install the package (tool)."
