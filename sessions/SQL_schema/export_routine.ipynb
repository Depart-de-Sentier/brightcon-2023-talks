    "The exporter can export one or many databases from the project at once. When multiple are selected they will be saved as one dataset in the SQL database, which means when that dataset is imported it will be imported as one database into the Brightway project. The reason is that in the project to be exported from the data might be split up into multiple Brightway databases for readability or structure, though they all belong together, e.g., imagine an LCA on a battery, there might be the BW databases \"Anode\", \"Cathode\", \"Assembly\", and \"End-of-life\" though they all describe the \"battery\" database, in this case you would specify `databases` as `[\"Anode\", \"Cathode\", \"Assembly\", \"End-of-life\"]`. They would all be merged into one \"battery\" dataset on the SQL server."

There are two relevant versions `3.8` and `3.9`. The biosphere version of your `biosphere3` database is set when you run `bw2setup()` and is dependent on the `bw2io` version of the virtual environment you are in.
